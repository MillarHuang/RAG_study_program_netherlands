1,"University of Amsterdam offers a Short or summer course program called 'Placemaking: Sense, Space & Strategy' in Amsterdam. The program lasts for 19 days. Program Overview: This three-week programme will explore the web of relationships between people and place. Placemaking as a philosophy and practice concerns the improvement of urban spaces by including its users in the transition for change. Through a bottom-up planning process, it intends to give the right to the city back to its inhabitants. This innovative course borrows from human geography, experimental and environmental-psychology, history, and sociology, problematising the urban environments in which we live. Experiencing the city through the many different sensory lenses is at the heart of this programme. It presents exciting alternative ways to understand how people live in, respond to, and imagine their cities. As cities are densely populated, and as their diversity increases, sensitivity to stimuli (both positive and negative) is increasing too. This holds true for all sensory experiences like increased noise, overwhelming smells, and the experience of intense density. Urban spaces can be imagined as territories of negotiation. Sensory experiences often inspire a strong sense of belonging and might therefore play an important role in the co-creation of space.  Early admission deadline: 1 February 2025. Final admission deadline: 15 March 2025. Applications are processed throughout the year on a rolling basis. This program awards a degree titled '-'. The language of instruction is English. The program duration is 19 days. It carries a total of 6 ECTS credits.

32,"Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam offers a Short or summer course program called 'Statistical Methods for Causal Inference' in Amsterdam. The program lasts for 15 days. Program Overview: There is great interest among students and practitioners today to understand the causal mechanisms underlying major events. Identifying cause-and-effect relationships is important for impact evaluation and effective policy design. Such identification can help us answer questions like: ""What causes an economic downturn?"", ""Does universal basic income reduce unemployment?"" and ""Does a carbon tax reduce greenhouse gas emissions?"" However, identifying causal relationships using data is often error prone. Differentiating causality from simple correlation requires learning and applying sophisticated quantitative tools. The golden standard of identifying causal linkages relies on designing experiments, often through randomised control trials. But designing a randomised control trial is not always feasible or ethical. Moreover, some events might have already happened in the past, such as a financial crisis or a cyclone. How can one use observational data to analyse the causal effects of such events? This course provides a hands-on introduction to statistical methods for causal inference. Over two weeks, students are introduced to experimental and quasi-experimental methods which allow them to infer cause-and-effect relationships robustly. This program awards a degree titled '-'.

65,"University of Amsterdam offers a Master program called 'History: American Studies' in Amsterdam. The program lasts for 1 year. Program Overview: In American Studies, we study the USA historically and with an eye toward the present. We explore politics and foreign policy, but also the culture that has influenced and reflected the world. American Studies at the UvA has always been interdisciplinary, and it has always encouraged a view of the United States from transnational and comparative perspectives. This has expanded in recent years to a global perspective. Our courses explore the political, cultural, economic and military presence of the United States abroad - both historically and with an eye toward America in the world today. Our field of inquiry spans high culture and mass culture, from intellectual history to the presence of America in popular media. For these reasons, doing American Studies in Europe is an asset and not a drawback. European views of the US have long been central to American Studies as a field, and the often contrapuntal relationship of Europe and America is a central theme of Atlantic history. Amsterdam - where one encounters American-style modernity in a major European cultural center - is an ideal vantage point.The lecturers come from an extremely broad range of academic backgrounds, thereby ensuring that the courses are highly interdisciplinary.

Program Overview: This summer course will introduce students to environmental justice from a variety of perspectives. We will engage with philosophical attempts to identify normative standards for what can be considered a just allocation of the benefits and burdens of environmental action. This includes questions such as: Should everybody have equal access to vital ecosystem services? Should rich countries pay for climate change adaptation in poorer countries? If so to what extent? But we will also critically scrutinize the value of philosophical reasoning as an approach to environmental justice. Does philosophy provide us with much needed impartial principles to guide our actions or is it too much of an armchair discipline, removed from what is going on in the ‘real world’? Is listening to stakeholders’ claims and the demands of environmental justice movements and activists a more practically relevant way to make sense of environmental justice? What are their objectives and strategies and how successful are they? We will also engage with environmental justice aspects of the assessment of impacts of conservation and other environmental policies and interventions.

125,"Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam offers a Master program called 'Humanities (research): Critical Studies in Art and Culture' in Amsterdam. The program lasts for 2 years. Program Overview: The Critical Studies in Art and Culture track focuses on current developments within four main disciplines – visual arts, architecture, design and media – from both a theoretical and a historical perspective. In a globalised cultural world in which art, architecture, design and media are ever more closely integrated, disciplinary boundaries are called into question and challenged. But a thorough grounding in older and newer disciplines such as art history, architectural history, design culture and media studies is a prerequisite for asking these questions. You’ll focus on the analysis of visual objects: artefacts in various media that function as images. This ranges from landscapes, cities and buildings to artworks in various media, as well as film, television, design and games. Notions such as inter-, cross- and transmediality play an important role. Since artefacts, media and forms of intermediality can only exist in specific social, institutional, economical and ideological contexts and networks, Critical Studies in Art and Culture will equip you with the analytical and critical tools necessary for analysing these. Each of the four main disciplines bring specific theories and methods to the table, and the programme seeks to highlight their interconnectedness, with reference to their specific potential as well as their possible limitations.

By taking an interdisciplinary approach, students will examine the juridical and empirical sides of these mass atrocities and by combining theory, interactive discussions and visits to the International Criminal Tribunals in The Hague, students will quickly develop a basic understanding of the most important issues concerning international criminal justice. Together with a group of expert lawyers and criminologists, you will explore what 'doing justice' means in practice and identify and discuss the most pressing challenges. In doing so, you will make the most of our location just 30 minutes away from the legal capital of the world, The Hague. Accompanied by experienced professionals, you will visit the most celebrated legal institutions of the world, such as the International Criminal Court, the Kosovo Specialist Chambers, and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon.

Program Overview: Scandals in public and private organizations are an everyday occurrence. Money laundering by banks, sexual abuse by employees of NGOs, and the marketing of unsafe products, are just a few of the reoccurring events that harm society. At the same time, many organizations are undertaking corporate social responsibility activities, with the clear intention to contribute positively to society. It is important for both scientists and the general public to better understand why organizations often want to act morally, yet fail to do so, and why others could be regarded as exemplary organizations. We will discuss insights from moral psychology, grounded in Social Identity Theory (SIT), to explain (im)moral behaviour in and by organizations. SIT argues that individuals derive their identity from (ideally positive) group memberships and that their behaviour usually follows from their self-definition as group members. For most people, the organization they work for is a very important 'group', with which they can identify, and which contributes to their self-image. This program awards a degree titled '-'.

215,"Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam offers a Master program called 'Economics: Labour and Health' in Amsterdam. The program lasts for 1 year. Program Overview: Human capital is the most valuable asset of individuals. Sufficient human capital allows people to be successful on the labour market and if individuals work they gain additional human capital. Health is a very important determinant of human capital. A well functioning labour market and health care market are therefore essential for any economy. Not surprisingly, these markets are the most important areas of attention of governments. However, the degree of regulation differs between markets and is often heavily debated. In this specialization, you learn about the trade-offs between efficiency and protection faced by policy makers when making decisions on the welfare state. This implies that you study the pros and cons of government interventions concerning for example benefits systems, health insurance markets, provision of long-term care and how to regulate care providers. Since there is no one-size-fits-all policy available for the labour market and markets associated to health, this specialization is largely empirical driven and compares different institutional settings.

217,"Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam offers a Master program called 'International Crimes, Conflict and Criminology' in Amsterdam. The program lasts for 1 year. Program Overview: Conflicts lead to looting, killing, recruitment of child soldiers, genocide – and even terrorism.

But also in its scope, because you’ll learn to combine insights and methodologies from several different disciplines: criminology, law, psychology, sociology and political science.

274,"University of Amsterdam offers a Short or summer course program called 'The Circular City: Towards a Sustainable Urban Ecosystem' in Amsterdam. The program lasts for 19 days. Program Overview: In this three-week summer programme, students are taught how to leverage the potential of cities via a new paradigm for urban planning and design: urban metabolism. While this concept has been around for over 50 years, recent interest in it has rejuvenated the fields of urban studies, industrial ecology, and architecture. Urban metabolism can be defined as the sum total of the technical and socio-economic processes that occur in cities, resulting in growth, and production of energy, materials, and waste. The city is viewed by its ‘material flows’, generally defined into water, energy, materials (including food), and waste. These flows consist of inputs (local, regional, and global inflow of resources), throughputs (energy required to transform these resources and waste produced by any process), and outputs (the material outcome of this process).  This interdisciplinary course unravels the complexity behind  truly sustainable urban development. Through the use of different tools, scientific methods and analysis, students will experience experimental urban design both theoretically, and gain an introduction to innovative tools and methods, able to apply their knowledge learned in a wide variety of settings. Early admission deadline: 1 February 2025. Final admission deadline: 15 March 2025. Applications are processed throughout the year on a rolling basis.

324,"Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam offers a Short or summer course program called 'From Preference to Choice: The Economic Theory of Decision-making' in Amsterdam. The program lasts for 5 days. Program Overview: This course shows that the core of economic theory is actually very broad, and highlights the linkages to other social sciences. It will also go into the question of why this core seems to have been forgotten in economics. Hence, during the Summer School, we follow the trail from individual preferences to individual choices, and from the latter to societal dilemmas and social choice—all under varying physical, monetary, political, or psychological circumstances. Along the way, we encounter utility maximization of the individual under a budget constraint—the bedrock of standard welfare economics—but also alternatives, such as lexicographic ordering and representations of individual and social choices on immaterial aspects of life (democratic values, concerns on equality, inclusivity, safety). We discuss interpretations of circumstances that determine freedom of choice, varying from marketing tools to concepts in game theory, political science and psychology. For decision making under uncertainty, the course contrasts maximization of expected utility with alternative models that can handle catastrophic risks, different types of uncertainty, and qualitative assessments of future outcomes. Throughout, the course connects theoretical representations with quantifiable model representations and includes hands-on exercises. This program awards a degree titled '-'.

327,"Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam offers a Short or summer course program called 'Buddhist Mindfulness and Spiritual Care' in Amsterdam. The program lasts for 15 days. Program Overview: The increasing interest in Buddhist spiritual caregiving and mindfulness is partly due to a disproportionate increase in mental distress and decrease in wellbeing, and the promise and potential of Buddhist approaches to these topics. The current popularity of mindfulness is at a peak and quite encouraging. However, there is often a lack of authentic input from the ancient Buddhist wisdom traditions. This lack has become an obstacle to deepened, embodied experiences, and has made mindfulness techniques often mechanistic and have diminished their true value and effectivity. The Buddhism team at the VU aims to cater for the need and the demand for rooted mindfulness by enabling students to explore the holistic and authentic Buddhist tradition that base mindfulness in its natural home. This course will introduce Buddhist mindfulness in theory and practice with special focus on Spiritual Care. We will learn about the basics of authentic Buddhist practice and mindfulness in context of globalisation; learn mindfulness meditation and practices; we further learn about Buddhist Chaplaincy in theory and practice and learn selected tools of applied Buddhist care such as Insight dialogue.

Program Overview: This master’s programme focuses on the economic dimensions of local, regional, and global environmental challenges, the use and depletion of natural resources, and the role of market-based policies to incentivize the adoption of environmentally friendly practices and technologies. These questions are important both for improving the sustainability of our current living standards and for fighting the devastating effects of climate change. The programme discusses how government and society can rise to the challenge of managing environmental quality, natural resources, and the energy transition effectively. Some examples of fundamental questions that we discuss are: What policies can best address pollution and other negative consequences of economic activities? What characterizes efficient exploitation of renewable resources (such as forestry and fishery) and non-renewable resources (such as fossil fuels and minerals), and how does this differ from a free-market outcome? How do environmental policies induce innovation, and what role do technology policies play in environmental regulation? How can climate policies avoid being undone by the unintended consequences of market responses like “carbon leakage”, the “rebound effect” or the “Green Paradox”?

338,"University of Amsterdam offers a Master program called 'History: Holocaust and Genocide Studies' in Amsterdam. The program lasts for 1 year. Program Overview: The Master's in Holocaust and Genocide Studies is unique in the Netherlands: a collaboration between the University of Amsterdam and the Netherlands Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies. The word genocide immediately evokes images of the mass murder of Jews during World War II. But there are more 20th-century examples of genocide: during World War I, Armenians were systematically persecuted and murdered, and more recently during the civil war in Rwanda Tutsis and moderate Hutus were also the victims of genocide. Is this kind of devastation a typical phenomenon resulting from twentieth-century genocidal ideology? The programme Holocaust and Genocide Studies attempts to explore this question. The curriculum of this programme is interdisciplinary and comparative in character, based on a flexible interpretation of the notion of genocide. Both the ideology behind a genocide (or mass atrocity) and the context of war or martial law will be discussed. Typical 20th-century aspects are examined, such as mass mobilisation, the role of bureaucracy, the function of media and the prosecution of those responsible for genocide. In addition, attention will be paid to research into how later generations have interpreted different genocidal processes. Holocaust and Genocide Studies is an accredited degree programme of History.

364,"Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam offers a Short or summer course program called 'Applied Public Policy Evaluation' in Amsterdam. The program lasts for 5 days. Program Overview: Many policy related empirical questions in economics are answered using detailed individual data and require analyzing individual behavior. This often implies that a causal parameters should be estimated to assess how a public policy affects individual outcomes. In many settings regression models provide correlations which only in special cases have a causal interpretation. In this course we discuss methods dealing with these confounding factors, such as omitted variables, reverse causality, measurement errors and non-random sampling. In particular, we consider limited dependent variable models, instrumental variables estimation and panel data models. We introduce the potential outcomes model, which is the most general model for defining treatment effects such as average treatment effect, average treatment effect on the treated, quantile treatment effects and local average treatment effects. The emphasis of the course is on identification, estimation and interpretation rather than a thorough treatment of the asymptotic properties of the estimators.

390,"University of Groningen offers a Master program called 'International Security' in Groningen. The program lasts for 1 year. Program Overview: How do actors relate to each other and their natural environment in terms of threats and vulnerabilities? When and how is violence organized? How can possible conflicts be prevented or solved? International Security, a track of the master International Relations, is aimed at issues of power politics and international order, peace and war, and strategy and diplomacy. Its main focus is the phenomenon of, and theoretical reflection on, 'violence' in its broader context.Traditionally, attention for warfare and political violence, i.e. military security, has dominated the study of International Security. They still form the central issues. But especially after the Cold War other concerns occupy the agenda, such as environmental security (about climate change or industrial hazards), societal security (about group identities) and economic security (about welfare and development). These different types of concerns have their own meaning when studying the causes of violent conflict, its prevention and management, and conflict resolution and reconciliation. Methodologically, the study of International Security has profited from the so-called constructivist turn in International Relations. In addition to traditional analyses new approaches have emerged, most notably Critical Security Studies, the Copenhagen School, and the Risk Society approach.

473,"University of Groningen offers a Master program called 'Arts, Policy and Cultural Entrepreneurship' in Groningen. The program lasts for 1 year. Program Overview: Art is inherently public. In this programme, you will study and reflect upon how public arts policy, arts management, arts marketing and education affect the realisation of artistic values in society. Traditionally, the arts have been regarded as a means for representing individual and collective identities, and for the reflection on, and critical assessment of, society. Increasingly, however, the arts are regarded as entertainment (e.g. based on notions such as the 'experience economy'), or as a means for the creative development of local economies ('creative and culture industries' and 'creative class'), or as a form of social engineering. The Arts, Policy and Cultural Entrepreneurship track focuses on the organizing of art and the public role of art in today's societies. Using methods from critical sociology, public policy studies, management studies, and cognitive perspectives on the arts you will learn to critically reflect upon the values that influence local and global art practices. On the basis of theory and empirical work, you will learn to analyze, criticize, and reflect upon the existing practices for art's sustenance, organization, and dissemination. You will learn to devise strategies on how the arts should be managed, marketed, and addressed by public policy agents in order to strengthen their role in society.

This MA equips you with the skills to explore specific lifeworlds across various contexts in order to gain a thorough understanding of the role of religion and culture in different societies. This MA in the anthropology of religion is unique in the Netherlands, and is characterised by its holistic, comparative and ethnographic approach.

Markets operate in Spartan competition and states and societies face the endeavour to cope with on-going globalization. IPE addresses these marvels. International Political Economy is a track within the Master's degree in International Relations. Since the 1970s, IPE has developed as an independent sub-discipline in International Relations (IR).

In doing so, IPE is interdisciplinary by its self-same nature. Why is it fascinating coming to grips with a globalizing world economy?

Program Overview: During the programme, you can specialise in themes such as conflict and peacebuilding, migration and gender. How are religion, conflict and peace related?

650,"Leiden University offers a Master program called 'Literary Studies: Literature in Society. Europe and Beyond' in Leiden. The program lasts for 1 year. Program Overview: The master in Literature in Society. Europe and Beyond offers specialised knowledge on the role and impact of literature in society. Novels, poetry, theatre and new literary media from both 'high’ and ‘popular’ culture reflect social issues but also shape them. Your studies thus take a thematic approach to the study of literature, exploring literature from the point of view of political and social issues like identity, migration, memory, and the metropolis. A transnational perspective Studying the impact of literature on society involves a series of questions: how does literature affect (or sometimes threaten) ways of life and moral standards? How do literary strategies such as story-telling shape the fields of politics and law? How does literature help shape individual and collective identity and memory? Conversely, society also shapes literature. This involves questions about the embeddedness of literature in culture and society; about the cultural capital of individual texts, genres and oeuvres: why are certain works and authors classified as classics and others as popular or ‘cult’? Much modern literature in Western Europe stands at the crossroads of European and non-European cultures. A transnational perspective is thus an important part of this Master. Leiden University is considered a leading centre of expertise in western and non-western languages and cultures. This program awards a degree titled 'Master of Arts'.

809,"Maastricht University offers a Master program called 'Health and Rehabilitation' in Maastricht. The program lasts for 1 year. Program Overview: Physical activity - whether the result of therapy, exercise training or a change in lifestyle - appears to be a simple yet effective means of improving cardiovascular, metabolic and even mental health. Furthermore, the ability to move in itself is a fundamental characteristic of human life, which may be hampered by illness, accidents or ageing. As such, understanding and improving human movement is an important objective of rehabilitation. Both aspects, i.e. human movement as a means to improve health and human movement as a goal in rehabilitation, are covered in this specialisation. This specialisation is primarily intended for those who are interested in performing and understanding research on the interaction between physical activity, mobility and health. Specific examples are: non-invasive ways to determine muscle health; use of wearable technology for health monitoring; use of motion analysis for evaluation and diagnostics of movement disorders; clinical biomechanics and neuro-rehabilitation.

816,"Maastricht University offers a Short or summer course program called 'The Philosophy and Sociology of Listening' in Maastricht. The program lasts for 5 days. Program Overview: What does it matter what people speak when no one listens? If one were to study all the academic fields, would one not essentially be listening to various experts from various fields making various claims about the same world? If no one would listen to each other’s unique experiences of the world and reality, how would we ever be able to organize ourselves in a well-functioning society? Isn’t listening then the predominant constitutive element of communication, knowledge, and society? Academic research and discourse predominantly focus on language and speaking, but little attention is given to the other side of language: listening. It should therefore not be all too surprising to the sensitive and careful observer that in everyday life we see more people talking past each other than listening to each other; much attention is demanded, little is supplied. How does listening therefore relate to the world and society, and vice versa? This is a crucial question to understand in order to tackle many issues in all fields of life as one will not find any part in life where listening is not utilized. This course will therefore focus on the transdisciplinary inquiry of listening (what listening is) and its wider relation to society. This program awards a degree titled '-'.

817,"Maastricht University offers a Short or summer course program called 'Medical Ethics' in Maastricht. The program lasts for 5 days. Program Overview: Those working in the medical professions are often confronted with decision-making procedures. These procedures go far beyond the mere technological aspects involved in the cases under investigation. Doctors and nurses are aware of the fact that their fields of operation are characterised by moral parameters as well and they know that ethical and philosophical reflection has to come in where scientific deliberation is no longer able to answer all the questions that are connected to the medical problems they have to deal with. This means that frequently, medical assessments require the assistance of an ethical and philosophical evaluation to cover completely the appraisal of a particular health situation and that doctors and nurses should be conscious of the moral status and implications of the conclusions they draw. The aim of this course is to give students an introductory and philosophical investigation of the question if, when and how ethical and philosophical considerations can or must play a role in the practice of the medical professions. Topics that will be addressed are for example: euthanasia, embryo research, HIV and Aids, imperilled new-borns, gene therapy and cloning, involuntary psychiatric treatment, and allocation of limited medical resources.

Program Overview: Individual behaviour can collectively drive people and systems towards unsustainable and vulnerable states, where common resources are exhausted and collapse, competition erodes redundancies and systemic risks build up. In this specialisation, we will identify under what circumstances such dynamics arise, and how public and private risk management could be used to increase resilience and sustainability. Important concepts touched upon in this specialisation are asymmetric information, time inconsistency, self-fulfilling prophecies, and contagion.

After you have studied this specialisation, you will be able to answer the following questions: What dynamics cause vulnerability and unsustainability of societies? How generalizable are these issues across different applications and fields? How can economic theory on the micro/meso/macro level be used to analyse real-life cases of unsustainability and vulnerability?

832,"Maastricht University offers a Short or summer course program called 'Gendered Economics: Gender from an Economic Perspective' in Maastricht. The program lasts for 5 days. Program Overview: Starting with the “founding fathers” economics was a male dominated field and it still remains so today as the majority of academic staff and undergraduate students are male compared to other disciplines. This large gender gap and slow change rate, leads the economics field to be shaped by men for men. Hence, the issues that females face get ignored and are often treated as social problems. This course aims to focus the attention of the students back to these problems and re-introduce them as economic problems that should matter to all rather than just half the population. The course will introduce the basic economic concepts and theories with relation to gender (such as tax, poverty, GDP, income effect, labour force participation rate, unemployment etc) and utilise statistics from different countries to portray a realistic picture of the world. By the end of the course, students will have a better understanding of economic concepts and understand how to incorporate gender inequality data to support their arguments. Students are not expected to have any prior knowledge of economics or gender, but an interest in gender equality or a fairer world is a must. Importantly, this course will be approaching gender as binary with respect to the data used. However, discussions on how to achieve a more diverse and fair world for all remains the primary goal.

842,"Maastricht University offers a Short or summer course program called 'Knowledge Management for Young Professionals' in Maastricht. The program lasts for 5 days. Program Overview: Managing your own knowledge has been a key success factor in many different disciplines. Two recent developments make careful knowledge management even more important for you as a young professional: the amount of available information has increased vastly over the past 25 years, while generative AI as a widely accessible tool has added competitive pressure on knowledge workers. Personal knowledge management can support you in addressing both: over the course of your studies and work, you collect and generate knowledge and insights. Keeping high-quality or “known good” information accessible to you can help you act on this knowledge even when it is no longer fresh in your mind, and can help you draw additional insights that are only available if you can zoom out and perceive the whole tapestry of knowledge. At the same time, personal knowledge management should cost little time on a daily basis: the goal is not to add work to your life, but instead to make it easy for you to retain insights. In five days of guided tutorials and exercises, this course will help you build a knowledge repository for yourself that you can start using immediately.

Program Overview: Game theory is used to analyse conflict situations, recognize guiding principles that determine stable outcomes and identify ways in which certain responses may be induced. The science of game theory has roots in philosophy, economics and mathematics and is finding increasing applications in management and politics. Increasingly, game theory is embedded in the culture of decision making and policy formulation. The objective of this course is to introduce students to the approach, concepts and methodology of game theory using simple puzzles compiled over nearly two decades of teaching game theory as well as articles from reputed newspapers (e.g. The New York Times) about contemporary societal problems. Working through such puzzles will give students practice with examples so that they can analyse real world problems described in the articles with the game theoretic tools. The originality of this course is that the application of abstract concepts shrouded in complex mathematics will be demystified using cartoons, newspaper texts and simple puzzles.

895,"Maastricht University offers a Short or summer course program called 'An Introduction to Game Theory' in Maastricht. The program lasts for 12 days. Program Overview: Game theory is used to analyse conflict situations, recognize guiding principles that determine stable outcomes and identify ways in which certain responses may be induced. The science of game theory has roots in philosophy, economics and mathematics and is finding increasing applications in management and politics. Increasingly, game theory is embedded in the culture of decision making and policy formulation. The objective of this course is to introduce students to the approach, concepts and methodology of game theory using simple puzzles compiled over nearly two decades of teaching game theory as well as articles from reputed newspapers (e.g. The New York Times) about contemporary societal problems. Working through such puzzles will give students practice with examples so that they can analyse real world problems described in the articles with the game theoretic tools. The originality of this course is that the application of abstract concepts shrouded in complex mathematics will be demystified using cartoons, newspaper texts and simple puzzles. Thus, this would be a unique opportunity for those without a background in mathematics or economics to understand the principles of game theory and learn to apply them to understand strategic problems or conflicts.

Program Overview: New information and communication technologies change existing markets, lead to the generation of new markets, and profoundly affect the actors in these markets. Companies have been able to leverage the availability of big data and new digital technologies to fundamentally change the functioning of existing markets.

945,"Radboud University offers a Master program called 'Computing Science' in Nijmegen. The program lasts for 2 years. Program Overview: The Computing Science Master's programme offers a solid, theoretical understanding of computer technology with plenty of attention for the wide range of ICT applications. The enormous and rapidly growing power of ICT is the main driving force shaping our modern society. This goes beyond the technical and economical aspects. ICT is also essential in research as all sciences benefit from the raw power of software in processing huge quantities of data. But how do we manage and control the complexity of modern software? How can we make the most of the opportunities? And, not to be forgotten, how can we secure the ICT infrastructures we so heavily rely on? The Master's programme in Computing Science at Radboud University covers all these aspects. Within this Master's programme, we offer 5 specialisations in each terrain: Cyber Security, Software Science, Data Science, Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science, and Cyber Security & AI. These are not, however, isolated disciplines. We also look at the interesting interplay between them. For example, by taking privacy into account when dealing with big data. And by doing a thorough analysis of newly designed software to prevent security breaches later. Thanks to a large number of optional courses, you can decide where you want your focus to be.

978,"Radboud University offers a Master program called 'Cognitive Computing' in Nijmegen. The program lasts for -. Program Overview: The specialisation in Cognitive Computing focuses on human cognition and its interaction with artificial intelligence by studying and designing artificial cognitive systems. As humans, we may be intrigued by the complexity of any daily activity. How does it actually work to perceive, to act, to decide, and to remember? On the one hand, if we understand how our own intelligence works, we can use this knowledge to make computers smarter. On the other hand, by making computers behave more like humans, we learn more about how our own cognition works. Its purpose is twofold: to gain a better understanding of the neuro-cognitive basis of human cognition, and to further the realisation of human-like and user-friendly cognition in artificial systems. The AI Master's programme at Radboud University has a distinctly cognitive focus. This cognitive focus leads to a highly interdisciplinary programme where students gain skills and knowledge from a number of different areas such as mathematics, computer science, psychology and neuroscience combined with a core foundation of artificial intelligence.

980,"Radboud University offers a Master program called 'Theology' in Nijmegen. The program lasts for 3 years. Program Overview: The main emphasis in the three-year Master's programme in Theology in Nijmegen is on research on Christian belief in contemporary society. The contemporary world is characterised by rapid innovations in science and technology. These developments contribute to economic growth and prosperity, but simultaneously require positioning, and more specifically people who can provide meaning and a meaningful direction. Theologians are those people as they are trained in systematic reflection of fundamental questions and ideas that feature in science, culture and faith. They can contribute to the dialogue between believing and knowing. Radboud University aims to train such theologians. The central focus in the three-year Master's programme in Theology is on the tension between universal truth claims within belief systems and the diverse cultural contexts in which they are expressed. We are concerned with how the Christian faith addresses matters in society at large and with the public relevance of Christian beliefs and doctrines. Christian engagement requires an intellectual as well as a practical basis. We therefore seek to provide academic rigor to the conception of theology. It's about contributing to the welfare of society by drawing on the insights, resources and compassionate values of the Christian faith. This program awards a degree titled 'Master of Arts'.

994,"Radboud University offers a Bachelor program called 'International Business Administration' in Nijmegen. The program lasts for 3 years. Program Overview: In the Business Administration programme at Radboud University, you examine all aspects of conducting business, with a focus on the role that humans and their interactions play in running a company. Business Administration offers you a broad range of topics, with consideration not only for international management, but also for psychology, sociology, communication, economics, and law. For example, there is ample consideration given to the role of social and cultural aspects within organisations. After all, employees are not just rational machines, but individuals with needs and desires that can shape and direct their behaviour and thus their performance. Conducting good business is a job involving extensive human interaction. Apart from looking at the stockholders within an organisation, like managers and employees, you will look at the interaction between other stakeholders involved, such as shareholders and clients; a framework that is even more complex and interesting within international interactions. We think it is important to educate graduates who have a broad overview of the organisation and its environment, and who are well aware of the influences of social processes within and outside the company. We teach Business Administration from different social-scientific disciplines and always consider culture in order to contribute to a broad mindset.

Program Overview: The MA Programme Fine Art consists of three parallel courses: Critical studies, Discipline Related studies and your Individual Project. 1 Presentation Many questions about the concept of image remain unanswered. To investigate the artistic image, we begin at the most primary form of visualization and representation, i.e. drawing. The meaning of drawing is the starting point for investigating the position and meaning of the image in current visual culture. 2 Representation The extreme of visualisation is the photographic image. The photograph often serves as final piece, recording, moment of distribution, and documentation. Visual culture contributes a high degree of truthfulness to the photograph. What does the photographic paradigm mean for topical, artistic practice? 3 Communication The following concepts are addressed: the position of the studio, the artistic attitude, the effect of painterly thought in current visual culture, filmic imagination, performativity, intermediality, transmedial communication, and the role of the artist's text. 4 Context The focus lies on contextualisation: an inquiry into how the artistic image should be presented. To investigate various exhibition models, a platform for practical research is offered. The role and position of art in public space is also investigated.

1124,"Utrecht University offers a Master program called 'Sustainable Finance and Investments' in Utrecht. The program lasts for 1 year. Program Overview: Today’s financial markets play a key role in tackling global environmental and social challenges. Regulators and society expect major capital suppliers to demonstrate the purpose they serve beyond financial goals. At the same time, the financial sector recognises that considering issues such as climate change and societal well-being in financial decision-making is not just the right thing but also a smart thing to do. It is the reason why the world’s leading institutional investors, banks and financial service providers are making sustainability and environmental, social and governance (ESG) an integral part of their core activities. For example, BNP Paribas and APG no longer finance the tobacco sector, while ABN AMRO and Triodos invest in companies that have a positive impact on society and earn competitive financial returns. This move towards sustainable finance creates the need for professionals who can use their knowledge of finance and sustainability to achieve financial and societal goals. This combined expertise is sought by major financial institutions and companies that seek to fulfil their financial goals while promoting a more sustainable financial market, economy and society.

1233,"Leiden University offers a Master program called 'MSc. Public Management and Leadership' in Den Haag. The program lasts for 1 year. Program Overview: Why does governance so often fail to effectively address societal problems? Why does the success of policy solutions vary so strongly across countries and policy domains? The specialisation Public Management and Leadership develops a theoretical and practical understanding of how management and leadership behavior is at the heart of understanding – and improving – public governance. The programme provides an internationally comparative perspective on how the actions of political executives, top-level bureaucrats, managers in government agencies, and front-line professionals ultimately determine successful governance. This expertise prepares you for a career in an (inter)national public organisation or management consultancy. Public governance broadly refers to the structures, processes and institutions used by government to address urgent societal problems. However, to understand what makes public governance work in practice, it is necessary to look beyond the structures and processes of government, and pay attention to the behavior of organisations and the individual actors that operate within them. This master specialisation uses management and leadership theory to critically analyze how the decisions and actions of public managers ultimately determine successful governance. In doing so, the programme has an internationally comparative and practice-oriented perspective. This program awards a degree titled 'Master of Science'. The language of instruction is English. The program duration is 1 year. It carries a total of 60 ECTS credits. The program is accredited by NVAO. To meet the English language requirement, applicants must achieve at least one of the following minimum scores: Cambridge Certificate of Proficiency in English (minimum score or level: 180); or IELTS overall band (minimum score or level: 6.5); or TOEFL internet based (minimum score or level: 90).

Program Overview: The international MSc Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences programme at TU Delft is especially strong in design, research, management, technology and research-by-design. The Faculty of Architecture at TU Delft offers a dynamic Master's programme very much informed by the unique circumstances of the Netherlands, where the high population density has strongly influenced thinking about how to work creatively with space. The Faculty has an outstanding reputation and attracts students from all over the world. The programme is especially strong in such areas as design, research, management, technology and research-by-design. The field of architecture used to be fairly straightforward – it was about the design of buildings. But these days, the field is far more complicated. Where in the past the emphasis was primarily on expanding the supply, far more attention is now directed to maintaining, adapting and replacing existing buildings and neighbourhoods. Construction as a field has therefore become more complex and specialised. That in turn increases the demand for architectural engineers with management skills – engineers who are capable of skilfully directing both the technical and logistical components of a construction project at every phase along the way from design to management of the completed structure.

Rotterdam is home base to quite many designers in all disciplines that have gained an international reputation. Many of them have been educated at WdKA: as a 'typical Rotterdam' academy it boasts a strong tradition in design education. Quite logical in a city that is an internationally orientated hub for trade and transport, and that is all about 'getting things done'. Rotterdam manifests itself - both nationally and internationally - as a 'city of design'. Proof of that is the biennial Rotterdam Design Prize. On the one hand, Rotterdam designers are characterized by their pragmatic 'hands on' approach (""don't fuss, just do it!""). On the other hand, they are renowned for their innovative and personal approach of design assignments. Over the past two decades, digital media have transformed all WdKA's design courses - like they transformed professional practice. Digital media are not just important as tools in the design process, but even more as a new arena for designers to work in. From day one, digital media are an integral part of the curriculum of all WdKA design courses. This program awards a degree titled 'Bachelor of Arts'. The language of instruction is English.

1533,"Erasmus University Rotterdam offers a Master program called 'Urban Housing & Land Justice: Equitable Access to Sustainable Land, Housing & Services' in Rotterdam. The program lasts for 11 months. Program Overview: This master track will focus on understanding, applying, and evaluating how the right to land, housing and urban services can be achieved. In a world with ample resources, knowledge, and skills, inequalities are growing worldwide. This manifests itself in economic inequality, social inequality, gender inequality, and housing inequality. Adequate housing is a basic need, a right, and not a privilege. Land and shelter remain unmet basic needs for many, with growing global land inequality fuelling housing disparities and limited access to services. Unequal land access underlies pressing societal issues, including housing injustice. The challenge of adequate housing persists globally, as vulnerable groups face displacement and limited infrastructure, while non-profitable land uses like affordable housing are marginalized. Due to ongoing commodification, this exclusivity affects global urban access to land, housing, and services. Addressing housing and land justice aligns with shared societal goals outlined in the New Urban Agenda (NUA) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Thus, the master track will focus on understanding, applying, and evaluating how the right to land, housing and urban services can be achieved. This program awards a degree titled 'Master of Science'. The language of instruction is English. The program duration is 11 months. It carries a total of 60 ECTS credits.

1548,"Erasmus University Rotterdam offers a Short or summer course program called 'Leadership and Communication' in Rotterdam. The program lasts for 3 days. Program Overview: It's essential that communication professionals gain a deep and solid understanding of general management, in order to effectively communicate their organisation's objectives and goals. It's essential that communications professionals first understand what managers and directors are trying to achieve – and the processes in the business – before they are able to communicate this information effectively throughout the organisation. This requires a good understanding of general management. You will perform detailed analyses of a range of business cases to aid your understanding; each one focuses on a different functional area of management.

1580,"Design Academy Eindhoven offers a Master program called 'Contextual Design' in Eindhoven. The program lasts for 2 years. Program Overview: Throughout the two-year course the Contextual Design Master aims to increase the students’ awareness of how each designed object, and each designed strategy, is a node in a network of relationships with other people, things, and contexts. To underscore the personal responsibility of the designer we speak of authorship, which is not taken in its narrow interpretation of personal ‘stardom’ or ‘signature design’, both of which are embraced by the market as seduction strategies, but the truer conception of authorship as accepting ‘ownership’ and working from genuine commitment. Authorship implies the designer takes personal responsibility for all implicit meanings of a design, as well as the implications and consequences it carries. One of the main aims of the Contextual Design Master is to cultivate the power of the imagination and narrative. No matter how tight a space we are in, it is through the power of imagination that we can create a space, a context, in which we can relate to not only ourselves but also to others. We ask our current and prospective students to imagine that they are boundless, as if they are free, even when constrained. The artistic talents and experiences of students are the fertile starting points for observing, researching and arriving at this space of freedom from which to question the world with their own design ethos and personal commitment.
