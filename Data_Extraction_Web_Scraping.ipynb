      "Program Overview: The Artificial Intelligence Master’s programme at VU Amsterdam looks specifically at hybrid intelligence, where AI and humans collaborate. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is widely used in our society: from cars that detect pedestrians to our smart phones’ virtual assistants. These applications use AI techniques to interpret information from a wide variety of sources, and in turn to enable intelligent, goal-directed behaviour. The Artificial Intelligence Master’s programme at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam looks specifically at hybrid intelligence, where AI systems and humans collaborate. The first year is made up of broad courses that focus on core AI topics, while the second year is devoted to your chosen area of specialisation. AI’s applications are highly diverse, ranging from optimising internet searches to supporting elderly people with dementia. The VU’s Artificial Intelligence programme allows you to analyse, develop and apply new AI techniques to come up with solutions that make sense within their social context. In collaboration with the Psychology department, we offer the specialised Cognitive Science track. In collaboration with Medical Informatics (UvA, Amsterdam UMC) we offer the specialised AI for Health track. This program awards a degree titled 'Master of Science'. The language of instruction is English. The program duration is 2 years. It carries a total of 120 ECTS credits. The program is accredited by NVAO. To meet the English language requirement, applicants must achieve at least one of the following minimum scores: IELTS overall band (minimum score or level: 6.5); or TOEFL paper based (minimum score or level: 580); or TOEFL computer based (minimum score or level: 237); or TOEFL internet based (minimum score or level: 92).
